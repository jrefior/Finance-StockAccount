### Buy 10 shares AAA in April
### Buy 20 shares BBB in May
### Sell 5 shares AAA in May
### Buy 50 shares CCC in May
### Buy 10 shares AAA in June
### Sell 20 shares BBB in June
### Buy 10 shares BBB in June
### Make no trades in July
### Outstanding shares at this point: (AAA 15) ; (BBB 10) ; (CCC 50)
### In August, close position in BBB
### In September, close position in CCC and sell 10 shares AAA
### Left with 5 shares AAA
### End of data
